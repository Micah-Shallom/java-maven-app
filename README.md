# Implementing CI/CD on a Java Based Application 

In this project, I setup a CICD pipeline using Jenkins.

Major Build Jobs in this pipeline includes:

- building the Java application
- containerizing the jar file using docker
- carrying out semantic app versioning of the java application before pushing to the docker repository
- pushing java application artifact to dockerhub
